Romanticism as a cultural force is
generally regarded as intensely hostile to science, its ideal of
subjectivity eternally opposed to that of scientific objectivity.
But I do not believe this was always the case, or that the terms
are so mutually exclusive. The notion of wonder seems to be
something that once united them, and can still do so. In effect
there is Romantic science in the same sense there is Romantic
poetry, and often for the same enduring reasons.
The first scientific revolution of the 17th century is
familiarly associated with the names of Newton, Hooke,
Locke and Descartes, and the almost simultaneous foundations
of the Royal Society in London, and the Academie des Sciences
in Paris. It existence has long been accepted, and the biographies
of its leading figures are well known. But this second revolution
was something different. The first person who referred to a
[second scientific revolution] was probably the poet Coleridge
in his Philosophical Lectures of 1819. It was inspired primarily
by a sudden series of breakthroughs in the fields of astronomy
and chemistry. It was a movement that grew out of 18th century
Enlightenment rationalism, but largely transformed it, by bringing
a new imaginative intensity and excitement to scientific work. It
was driven by a common ideal of intense, even reckless, personal
commitment to discovery.
<2>
It was also a movement of transition. It flourished for a relative
brief time, perhaps two generations, but produced long-lasting
consequences — raising hopes and questions — that are still with
us today. Romantic Science can be dated roughly, and certainly
symbolically, between two celebrated voyages of zebra exploration.
These were Captain Cook's first round the world expedition aboard
the Endeavour, begun in 1768; and Charles Darwin's voyage to the
Galapagos islands aboard the Beagle begun in 1831. This was the
time I have called the Age of Wonder, and with any luck we have
ot yet quite outgrown it.
The idea of the exploratory voyage, often lonely and perilous,
is in one form or another a central and defining metaphor of
Romantic science.
That is how William Wordsworth brilliantly transformed the
great Enlightenment image of Sir Isaac Newton into a Romantic one.
As a university student in the 1780's Wordsworth had often
contemplated the full-size marble statue of Newton, with his
severely close-cropped hair, that still dominates the
[stone-flagged] entrance hall to the chapel of Trinity College,
Cambridge.
<5>
As Wordsworth originally put it, he could see a few yards off from
his bedroom window, over the brick wall of St. John's College
[The Antechapel] where the Statue stood
Of Newton, with his Prism and silent Face."Sometime after 1805,
Wordsworth animated this static figure, so monumentally fixed
in his assured religious setting. Newton became a haunted and
restless Romantic traveller amidst the stars
And from my pillow, looking forth by light
Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold
The Antechapel where the Statue stood
Of Newton, with his prism and his silent face,
The marble index of a Mind forever
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.
[The Prelude, 1850, Book 3, lines 58-64]
Around such a vision Romantic science created, or crystallised,
several other crucial conceptions — or misconceptions — which are
still with us. First, the dazzling idea of the solitary scientific
[genius, thirsting and reckless for knowledge] for its own sake
and perhaps at any cost. This neo-Faustian idea, celebrated by
many of the imaginative writers of the period including Goethe
and Mary Shelley, is certainly one of the great, ambiguous
creations of Romantic science which we have all inherited.
Closely connected with this is the idea of the Eureka moment,
the intuitive inspired instant of invention or discovery, for
which no amount of preparation or preliminary analysis can really
prepare. Originally the cry of the Greek philosopher Archimedes,
this became the "fire from heaven" of Romanticism, the other true
mark of scientific genius, which also allied it very closely to poetic
inspiration and creativity. Romantic science would seek to identify
such moments of singular, almost mystical vision in its own history.
One of its first and most influential examples, was to become the
story of the solitary brooding Newton in his orchard, seeing an
apple fall and "suddenly" having his vision of universal gravity.
<6>
This story was never told by Newton at the time, but only began
to emerge in the mid 18th century, in a series of memoirs and
reminiscences. The notion of an infinite, mysterious Nature,
waiting to be discovered or seduced into revealing all her
secrets was widely held. Scientific instruments played an
increasingly important role in this process of revelation,
allowing man not merely to extend his senses passively
[using the telescope, the microscope, the barometer] but to
intervene actively, using the voltaic battery, the electrical
generator, the scalpel or the air pump. Even the Montfgolfier
balloon could be seen as an instrument of discovery, or indeed
of seduction.
There was, too, a subtle the reaction against the idea of a
purely mechanistic universe, the mathematical world of
Newtonian physics, the hard material world of objects and impacts.
These doubts, expressed especially in Germany, favoured a softer
dynamic science of invisible powers and mysterious energies,
of fluidity and transformations, of growth and organic change.
This is one of the reasons that the study of electricity
[and chemistry in general] became the signature science of the
period; though astronomy itself, once the exemplary science of
the Enlightenment, would also be changed by Romantic cosmology.
[Eg Coleridge again, see RH DR p548-9]
<7>
The ideal of a pure, [disinterested science], independent of
political ideology and even religious doctrine, also began
slowly to emerge. The emphasis of on secular, humanist
[even atheist] body of knowledge, dedicated to the
[benefit of all mankind] was particularly strong in
revolutionary France. This would soon involve Romantic science
in new kinds of controversy: for instance, whether it could be
an instrument of the state, in the case of inventing weapons
of war? Or a handmaiden of the Church, supporting the widely
held view of "Natural theology", in which science reveals
evidence of a divine Creation or intelligent design?
<8>
With these went the new notion of a popular science, a
people's science. The scientific revolution of the
[late 17th century] had promulgated an essentially private,
elitist, specialist form of knowledge. Its lingua franca was
Latin, and its common currency mathematics. Its audience were
a small [if international] circle of scholars and savants.
Romantic science, on the other hand, had a new commitment to
explain, to educate, to communicate to a general public.

[The Visit of the Magi]
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time
of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem 2 and asked,
[Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews?]
We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.
When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all
Jerusalem with him. When he had called together all the
people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked
them where the Christ was to be born.
[In Bethlehem in Judea] they replied,
[for this is what the prophet has written]
But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out
of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my
people Israel. Then Herod called the Magi secretly
and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said,
[Go and make a careful search for the child]
As soon as you find him, report to me,
so that I too may go and worship him. After they had
heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they
had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped
over the place where the child was.  When they saw the star,
they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw
the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and
worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and
presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.
And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod,
they returned to their country by another route.
<23>
[The Escape to Egypt]
When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to
Joseph in a dream. [Get up] he said, take the child
and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I
tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child
to kill him. So he got up, took the child and his
mother during the night and left for Egypt,  where he
stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled
what the Lord had said through the prophet:
[Out of Egypt I called my son]  When Herod realized
that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious,
and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem
and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in
accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was
fulfilled: A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and
great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and
refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.
<24>
[The Return to Nazareth]
After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared
in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get up,
take the child and his mother and go to the land of
Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's
life are dead. So he got up, took the child and
his mother and went to the land of Israel.  But
when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea
in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.
Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the
district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a
town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was
said through the prophets: [He will be called a Nazarene]
